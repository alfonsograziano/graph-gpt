# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: Strict Content Security Policy with nonce-based scripts
- XSS Prevention: React's built-in XSS protection with proper sanitization
- Secure Storage: No sensitive data in localStorage, use httpOnly cookies

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation for all API inputs
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP
- CORS Policy: Restrict to production domains only

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: httpOnly cookies with secure flags
- Session Management: JWT tokens with short expiration
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 500KB initial bundle
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Caching Strategy: Service worker with cache-first strategy

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms for API responses
- Database Optimization: Proper indexing and query optimization
- Caching Strategy: Redis for frequently accessed data
