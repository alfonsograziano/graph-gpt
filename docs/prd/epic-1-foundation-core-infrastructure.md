# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure for the graph-based LLM interface, including project setup, database configuration, and basic conversation CRUD operations. This epic delivers the core data layer and basic user interface for managing conversations.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Database Configuration

As a developer,
I want to set up the Next.js project with TypeScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose,
so that I have a solid foundation for building the graph-based LLM interface.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js project is initialized with TypeScript configuration
2. MongoDB connection is established using Mongoose
3. Shared TypeScript types are defined for Conversation, Node, and Edge entities
4. Basic project structure is organized with proper separation of concerns
5. Environment variables are configured for database connection
6. Basic error handling and logging are implemented

## Story 1.2: Conversation Data Model and API

As a developer,
I want to implement the conversation data model and basic CRUD operations,
so that conversations can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Mongoose schema is defined for Conversation entity with all required fields
2. API routes are created for conversation CRUD operations (/api/conversations)
3. Conversation data includes nodes, edges, positions, title, and metadata
4. Data validation is implemented for conversation schema
5. Error handling is implemented for database operations
6. API responses follow consistent format with proper HTTP status codes

## Story 1.3: Homepage and Conversation List

As a user,
I want to see a list of all my conversations on the homepage,
so that I can easily navigate between different conversation sessions.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Homepage displays list of all conversations with titles and timestamps
2. Each conversation shows creation date and last modified time
3. Users can click on conversations to navigate to the conversation canvas
4. "New Conversation" button creates a new conversation with auto-generated title
5. Conversation titles are displayed in a clean, readable format
6. Empty state is shown when no conversations exist
7. Responsive design works on desktop and tablet devices

## Story 1.4: Basic Conversation Canvas Structure

As a user,
I want to access a conversation canvas when I click on a conversation,
so that I can start interacting with the graph-based interface.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Conversation canvas page is accessible at /chat/[id] route
2. Canvas displays conversation title in top-left corner
3. Title is clickable and allows renaming functionality
4. Basic React Flow canvas is rendered with proper dimensions
5. Conversation data is loaded and displayed correctly
6. Navigation back to homepage is available
7. Page handles loading states and error conditions
