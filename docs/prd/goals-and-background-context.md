# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create a non-linear, graph-based interface for LLM interactions that mirrors human thinking patterns
- Enable users to explore multiple conversation paths simultaneously from a single starting point
- Provide intuitive node-based conversation management with visual graph representation
- Support branching conversations with contextual connections based on markdown content
- Deliver a seamless streaming experience with real-time markdown rendering
- Enable conversation persistence and management across multiple sessions

## Background Context

Traditional LLM chat interfaces force users into linear conversation flows, which doesn't align with how humans naturally think and explore ideas. Humans often need to explore multiple hypotheses, debug different approaches, or branch off into related topics during a single thinking session. The current linear chat paradigm limits this natural cognitive process.

This product addresses this fundamental limitation by providing a graph-based interface where users can create multiple conversation branches from any point in their interaction with an LLM. The interface uses React Flow to create an intuitive visual representation of conversation threads, allowing users to explore different paths, return to previous branches, and build complex knowledge graphs through their interactions.
