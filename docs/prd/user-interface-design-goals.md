# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface should feel like a natural extension of human thought processes, where ideas can branch, connect, and evolve organically. The graph visualization should be intuitive enough that users can immediately understand how to create branches and navigate between different conversation threads. The design should prioritize clarity and simplicity while providing powerful branching capabilities.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Node-based Conversations:** Each conversation thread is represented as a node with clear visual states (input, loading, completed)
- **Visual Graph Navigation:** Users can click nodes to activate conversation paths and see the relationship between different branches
- **Contextual Branching:** Users can create new branches from specific parts of markdown content, maintaining semantic connections
- **Real-time Streaming:** LLM responses stream in real-time with proper markdown rendering for immediate feedback
- **Persistent State:** All interactions are automatically saved and synchronized across sessions

## Core Screens and Views

- **Homepage:** List of all conversations with creation and navigation capabilities
- **Conversation Canvas:** Main graph interface with React Flow visualization
- **Node Component:** Individual conversation nodes with input, loading, and content states
- **Settings/Preferences:** Future consideration for user preferences and customization

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The interface shall meet WCAG AA standards for accessibility, including proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast for node states and text content.

## Branding

Clean, modern interface with focus on readability and usability. Minimal design that doesn't distract from the conversation content.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop and tablet web browsers with responsive design principles. Mobile optimization may be considered in future iterations.
