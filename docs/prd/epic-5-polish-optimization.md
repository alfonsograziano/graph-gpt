# Epic 5: Polish & Optimization

**Goal:** Add final polish, error handling, performance optimizations, and user experience enhancements to deliver a production-ready graph-based LLM interface.

## Story 5.1: Error Handling and User Feedback

As a user,
I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur,
so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Network errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
2. LLM API errors provide clear feedback and retry options
3. Database errors are handled without data loss
4. Error states are visually distinct and informative
5. Error recovery options are provided where possible
6. Error logging is implemented for debugging purposes
7. Error handling doesn't break the user experience

## Story 5.2: Performance Optimization

As a developer,
I want to optimize the application for performance,
so that users have a smooth experience even with large graphs.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Large graphs (100+ nodes) render and interact smoothly
2. Node rendering is optimized to prevent performance degradation
3. State updates are batched to minimize re-renders
4. Memory usage is optimized for long-running sessions
5. API calls are optimized to reduce unnecessary requests
6. Graph layout algorithms are efficient for complex structures
7. Performance monitoring is implemented for ongoing optimization

## Story 5.3: User Experience Enhancements

As a user,
I want a polished and intuitive interface,
so that I can focus on my conversations without interface distractions.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Loading states are smooth and informative
2. Transitions between states are visually appealing
3. Interface is responsive and works well on different devices
4. Keyboard shortcuts are available for common actions
5. Visual feedback is consistent throughout the application
6. Interface follows modern design principles
7. User experience is intuitive for new users

## Story 5.4: Data Management and Backup

As a user,
I want my conversations to be safely stored and recoverable,
so that I don't lose important conversation data.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Conversation data is properly backed up and recoverable
2. Data validation prevents corruption and invalid states
3. Data migration handles schema changes gracefully
4. Export functionality allows users to backup conversations
5. Data retention policies are implemented appropriately
6. Data security measures protect user information
7. Data management doesn't impact application performance
