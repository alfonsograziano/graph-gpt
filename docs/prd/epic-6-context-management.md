# Epic 6: Context Management & Props Drilling Elimination

**Goal:** Implement React Context to eliminate props drilling and centralize state management across the conversation interface, making the codebase more maintainable and reducing component coupling.

## Story 6.1: Create Conversation Context Foundation

As a developer,
I want to create a centralized conversation context that wraps the ConversationPage,
so that I can eliminate props drilling and provide a clean foundation for state management.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. A new `ConversationContext` is created with proper TypeScript types
2. Context provides conversation data, loading states, and core actions
3. Context is wrapped around the ConversationPage component
4. Context includes proper error handling and loading states
5. Context follows React best practices for performance optimization
6. Context is properly exported and can be consumed by child components
7. Initial implementation maintains existing functionality without breaking changes

## Story 6.2: Migrate GraphCanvas to Context

As a developer,
I want to migrate GraphCanvas to use the conversation context,
so that it no longer requires extensive prop drilling from ConversationPage.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. GraphCanvas consumes conversation data from context instead of props
2. All conversation-related props are removed from GraphCanvas interface
3. GraphCanvas maintains all existing functionality
4. Node interaction handlers are accessible through context
5. Streaming state is managed through context
6. Performance is maintained or improved
7. No breaking changes to existing user experience

## Story 6.3: Migrate Node Components to Context

As a developer,
I want to migrate individual node components to use the conversation context,
so that they can access conversation state without prop drilling.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. ConversationNode component uses context for conversation data
2. NodeInput component accesses context for message submission
3. NodeLoading and NodeCompleted components use context for state
4. All node components maintain existing functionality
5. Props interfaces are simplified by removing conversation-related props
6. Node components can access streaming state through context
7. Performance is optimized with proper context consumption patterns

## Story 6.4: Migrate UI Components to Context

As a developer,
I want to migrate UI components to use the conversation context,
so that they can access conversation state and actions without prop drilling.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. EditableTitle component uses context for title management
2. StreamingToggle component accesses streaming state through context
3. Button components can access conversation actions through context
4. All UI components maintain existing functionality
5. Props interfaces are simplified by removing conversation-related props
6. UI components can trigger conversation actions through context
7. Context provides proper separation of concerns

## Story 5.5: Optimize Context Performance

As a developer,
I want to optimize the conversation context for performance,
so that the application remains responsive and efficient.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Context is split into logical chunks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. Memoization is properly implemented for expensive operations
3. Context consumers only re-render when their specific data changes
4. Performance monitoring shows no degradation from context implementation
5. Memory usage is optimized for long-running sessions
6. Context updates are batched to minimize re-renders
7. Performance tests pass with context implementation

## Story 6.6: Clean Up and Documentation

As a developer,
I want to clean up the codebase and document the new context architecture,
so that future development is easier and the architecture is well-understood.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All unused props and interfaces are removed from components
2. Context usage is documented with examples
3. Component interfaces are simplified and well-documented
4. Architecture documentation is updated to reflect context usage
5. Code is properly commented and follows best practices
6. All tests pass with the new context architecture
7. Migration guide is created for future context additions
