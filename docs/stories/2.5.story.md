# Story 2.5: Node Activation and Path Calculation

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to click on nodes to activate them and see the conversation path,
**so that** I can understand which nodes will be used as context for new messages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking a node activates it and all nodes in path back to source
2. Active nodes have white background, inactive nodes have light-gray background
3. Path calculation correctly identifies all nodes from clicked node to root
4. Visual feedback clearly shows which nodes are active
5. Node activation works correctly regardless of graph complexity
6. Activation state is maintained until user clicks different node
7. Path calculation handles complex branching scenarios correctly
