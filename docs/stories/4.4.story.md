# Story 4.4: Advanced Graph Navigation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to navigate complex graphs with multiple branches,
**so that** I can explore different conversation paths effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Graph navigation handles complex branching scenarios
2. Node activation works correctly with multiple active paths
3. Visual feedback clearly shows active and inactive nodes
4. Graph layout automatically adjusts for new nodes and connections
5. Navigation performance remains smooth with large graphs
6. Graph state is properly maintained during navigation
7. Navigation works consistently across different graph structures

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Stories 4.1-4.3 establish markdown anchors, context preprocessing, and edge management
- Edge customization system provides foundation for complex graph structures
- Node activation system needs enhancement for multiple active paths

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Node model includes `type` field for different node states
- Edge model supports complex connection types
- Conversation model contains arrays of nodes and edges for graph structure
- Position model provides x,y coordinates for node layout

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Graph state synchronization API should handle complex navigation
- Node position updates should be batched for performance
- Graph layout calculations may need backend support for large graphs

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- GraphCanvas component needs navigation enhancements
- ConversationNode component needs activation state improvements
- New GraphNavigation component for navigation controls
- Components should integrate with React Flow for layout management

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Update existing: `src/components/graph/GraphCanvas.tsx`
- Update existing: `src/components/graph/ConversationNode.tsx`
- New component: `src/components/graph/GraphNavigation.tsx`
- Update context: `src/context/GraphContext.tsx`
- Update hooks: `src/hooks/useGraphState.ts`
- New utilities: `src/utils/graphNavigation.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Unit tests: `tests/components/graph/GraphNavigation.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `tests/components/graph/GraphCanvas.test.tsx`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/graph-navigation.spec.ts`
- Performance tests: `tests/e2e/graph-performance.spec.ts`
- Test file location follows `tests/components/` structure
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Playwright for E2E tests

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All API calls must go through service layer
- State updates must use proper state management patterns through GraphContext
- Graph operations must go through GraphContext
- Performance optimizations should not compromise functionality
- Type sharing through `src/types/` directory

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: `tests/components/graph/` for component tests, `tests/e2e/` for E2E tests
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Test patterns**: Follow established component test patterns with proper mocking
- **E2E requirements**: Test complete navigation flow with complex graph structures
- **Performance testing**: Include performance benchmarks for large graphs
- **Coverage requirements**: All navigation functionality must be covered by tests
