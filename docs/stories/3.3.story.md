# Story 3.3: Streaming Response Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see LLM responses stream in real-time via HTTP streaming,
**so that** I can read the response as it's being generated and toggle streaming on/off as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. LLM responses stream in real-time to the frontend via HTTP streaming
2. Streaming uses HTTP response streaming (not SSE)
3. Markdown content is rendered progressively as it streams
4. "Generating" state is shown when response starts but no content yet
5. "Generating" text is hidden when content starts arriving, showing partial markdown
6. Streaming can be toggled on/off via frontend switch
7. Response quality and formatting are maintained during streaming
8. Streaming performance is smooth without noticeable delays
