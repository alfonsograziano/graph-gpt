# Story 3.3: Streaming Response Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see LLM responses stream in real-time with progressive markdown rendering,
**so that** I can read the response as it's being generated and see the formatting appear progressively.

### UI/UX Flow:
1. **Initial State**: When user submits a message, show "Generating..." with loading spinner
2. **First Chunk Arrives**: Immediately switch to showing partial markdown content (still in loading state)
3. **Progressive Updates**: Continue showing markdown content as it streams in real-time
4. **Completion**: When streaming finishes, show the complete node with branch button and full functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

1. LLM responses stream in real-time to the frontend
2. Markdown content is rendered progressively as it streams
3. Loading state is properly managed during streaming
4. Streaming handles connection interruptions gracefully
5. Response quality and formatting are maintained during streaming
6. Streaming performance is smooth without noticeable delays

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 3.2 Context** [Source: stories/3.2.story.md]
- Context flattening and path traversal are implemented
- ContextService handles conversation path processing
- Path calculation and context management are working
- Chat API integration with context is complete

**Story 3.1 Context** [Source: stories/3.1.story.md]
- OpenAI API integration is implemented
- Basic chat API route exists
- Request/response data models are defined
- Error handling and monitoring are in place

### Implementation Strategy
**Streaming Approach**: Use POST requests with ReadableStream API instead of EventSource
- POST requests support request body for context and parameters
- ReadableStream API provides better control over streaming data
- No browser connection limits like EventSource
- Better error handling and retry logic

**UI State Management**:
1. **Initial**: Node type = "loading", show "Generating..." spinner
2. **First Chunk**: Keep node type = "loading", show markdown content with MarkdownRenderer
3. **Completion**: Change node type = "completed", show full functionality

### Data Models
**StreamingResponse Interface**
```typescript
interface StreamingResponse {
  type: "chunk" | "complete" | "error";
  content: string;
  nodeId: string;
  conversationId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  isComplete: boolean;
  metadata?: {
    chunkIndex: number;
    totalChunks?: number;
    tokensUsed?: number;
  };
}
```

**StreamingConfig Interface**
```typescript
interface StreamingConfig {
  chunkSize: number;
  flushInterval: number;
  maxRetries: number;
  timeout: number;
  enableCompression: boolean;
}
```

**StreamingState Interface**
```typescript
interface StreamingState {
  isStreaming: boolean;
  streamingContent: string;
  connectionStatus: "connected" | "disconnected" | "error";
  nodeId: string;
  error?: string;
}
```
