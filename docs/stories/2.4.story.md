interface Position {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
```

- Active nodes have white background
- Inactive nodes have light-gray background
- Activation state managed through GraphContext
- Visual feedback for active/inactive states

**State Management Patterns** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]
