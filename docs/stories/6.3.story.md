# Story 6.3: Migrate Node Components to Context

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to migrate individual node components to use the conversation context,
**so that** they can access conversation state without prop drilling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ConversationNode component uses context for conversation data
2. NodeInput component accesses context for message submission
3. NodeLoading and NodeCompleted components use context for state
4. All node components maintain existing functionality
5. Props interfaces are simplified by removing conversation-related props
6. Node components can access streaming state through context
7. Performance is optimized with proper context consumption patterns

- [ ] Task 5: Update node component props interfaces (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Remove conversation-related props from all node components
  - [ ] Remove handler props that are now in context
  - [ ] Keep only essential props like node data, styling, etc.
  - [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces and documentation
  - [ ] Ensure props are minimal and focused

- [ ] Task 6: Optimize context consumption for node components (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Use React.memo for node components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - [ ] Implement selective context consumption for each component
  - [ ] Add proper dependency arrays for context hooks
  - [ ] Monitor performance impact of context migration
  - [ ] Ensure only relevant context values trigger re-renders

- [ ] Task 7: Update node component tests (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Update test setup to provide ConversationContext for all node components
  - [ ] Mock context values in tests instead of props
  - [ ] Test context consumption for each node component
  - [ ] Test streaming state integration
  - [ ] Ensure all existing test cases pass with context

- [ ] Task 8: Update GraphCanvas integration (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Update GraphCanvas to pass minimal props to node components
  - [ ] Remove conversation-related props from node component calls
  - [ ] Ensure node components receive only necessary data
  - [ ] Test that node rendering and interaction still works

- [ ] Task 9: Update node component documentation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Update JSDoc comments to reflect context usage
  - [ ] Document new props interfaces for each component
  - [ ] Add examples of context consumption
  - [ ] Update component usage examples and patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Stories 6.1 and 6.2 completion]
- ConversationContext is implemented with proper TypeScript types
- Context provides conversation data, loading states, and core actions
- GraphCanvas has been migrated to use context instead of props
- Context is wrapped around ConversationPage component
- useConversationContext hook is available for consumption

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- Node components should consume conversation data from GraphState
- Node interaction handlers should be available through context actions
- Streaming state should be managed through context state
- Node data should be accessed through context instead of props

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- Node components are located in src/components/graph/
- Components include: ConversationNode.tsx, NodeInput.tsx, NodeLoading.tsx, NodeCompleted.tsx
- Components should consume context instead of receiving props
- Node interaction handlers should be accessible through context
- Components should maintain React Flow node integration

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Node components: src/components/graph/ConversationNode.tsx, NodeInput.tsx, NodeLoading.tsx, NodeCompleted.tsx
- Context: src/context/ConversationContext.tsx
- Test files: tests/components/graph/ (for each node component)
- Types: src/types/index.ts

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Test file locations: tests/components/graph/ConversationNode.test.tsx, NodeInput.test.tsx, etc.
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock ConversationContext provider in tests
- Test context consumption for each node component
- Follow frontend component test patterns with proper context setup

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use React Context + useReducer for state management
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- React Flow 11+ for node visualization
- Follow coding standards for component interfaces and context usage

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]
- Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement selective context consumption for each component
- Avoid over-rendering by consuming only necessary context values
- Maintain existing performance characteristics for node rendering

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Test file locations: tests/components/graph/ for each node component
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock ConversationContext provider with test values
- Test context consumption for each node component
- Test streaming state integration
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Follow frontend component test patterns with proper context setup
