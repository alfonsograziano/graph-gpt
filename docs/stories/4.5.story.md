# Story 4.5: Graph State Synchronization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement robust state synchronization,
**so that** all graph changes are properly saved and synchronized.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All node changes trigger automatic backend synchronization
2. Edge modifications are immediately saved to database
3. Position changes are synchronized with debounced updates


## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement automatic node synchronization (AC: 1, 6)
  - [ ] Create node change detection system
  - [ ] Implement automatic backend synchronization for node updates
  - [ ] Add optimistic updates with rollback capability
  - [ ] Create node synchronization queue management

- [ ] Task 2: Add edge synchronization system (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Implement edge modification detection
  - [ ] Create immediate edge synchronization to database
  - [ ] Add edge change validation and error handling
  - [ ] Implement edge synchronization conflict resolution

- [ ] Task 3: Implement debounced position synchronization (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Create debounced position update system
  - [ ] Implement position change batching
  - [ ] Add position synchronization performance optimization
  - [ ] Create position update conflict resolution


- [ ] Task 6: Testing and validation (AC: 1-7)
  - [ ] Write unit tests for synchronization services
  - [ ] Add integration tests for state synchronization
  - [ ] Create E2E tests for network interruption scenarios
  - [ ] Test conflict resolution and data consistency

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Stories 4.1-4.4 establish markdown anchors, context preprocessing, edge management, and navigation
- Complex graph operations require robust synchronization
- Edge customization and navigation changes need immediate backend updates

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Node model includes `updatedAt` timestamp for change tracking
- Edge model includes `createdAt` timestamp for modification tracking
- Conversation model contains arrays of nodes and edges requiring synchronization
- Position model needs synchronization for layout changes

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Need synchronization API endpoints for real-time updates
- Batch update endpoints for position changes
- Conflict resolution API for concurrent edit handling
- State validation endpoints for consistency checks

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- GraphContext needs synchronization state management
- State management patterns should include synchronization status
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Debounced updates for performance optimization

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- New service: `src/services/synchronizationService.ts`
- Update existing: `src/services/conversationService.ts`
- Update context: `src/context/GraphContext.tsx`
- Update hooks: `src/hooks/useGraphState.ts`
- New utilities: `src/utils/synchronizationUtils.ts`
- API route: `src/app/api/sync/route.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- Unit tests: `tests/services/synchronizationService.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `tests/api/sync.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/synchronization.spec.ts`
- Test file location follows `tests/services/` and `tests/api/` structure
- Use Jest + Supertest for API testing
- Use Playwright for E2E tests

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All API calls must go through service layer
- State updates must use proper state management patterns through GraphContext
- Error handling through standard error handler
- Synchronization should not block user interactions
- Type sharing through `src/types/` directory

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: `tests/services/` for service tests, `tests/api/` for API tests, `tests/e2e/` for E2E tests
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest + Supertest for backend tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Test patterns**: Follow established service test patterns with proper mocking
- **E2E requirements**: Test complete synchronization flow including network interruptions
- **Performance testing**: Include synchronization performance benchmarks
- **Coverage requirements**: All synchronization functionality must be covered by tests
