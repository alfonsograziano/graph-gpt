# Story 2.1: React Flow Canvas Integration

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate React Flow into the conversation canvas,
**so that** I can display and interact with graph-based conversation nodes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Flow is properly installed and configured
2. Canvas displays with appropriate dimensions and styling
3. Basic zoom and pan functionality works correctly
4. Canvas handles node positioning and layout
5. Proper TypeScript types are defined for React Flow elements
6. Canvas is responsive and works on different screen sizes

- [x] Task 4: Configure Node Positioning and Layout (AC: 4)
  - [x] Set up proper node positioning system
  - [x] Configure automatic layout options
  - [x] Implement fitView functionality
  - [x] Test node positioning with different graph sizes

- [x] Task 5: Define TypeScript Types for React Flow Elements (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create proper Node type definitions
  - [x] Create proper Edge type definitions
  - [x] Define custom node data interfaces
  - [x] Ensure type safety for all React Flow operations

- [x] Task 6: Create Unit Tests (AC: 1-6)
  - [x] Test GraphCanvas component rendering
  - [x] Test zoom and pan functionality
  - [x] Test responsive behavior
  - [x] Test node positioning and layout

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories completed yet - this is the first story in Epic 2.

### Data Models
**Node Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
```typescript
interface Node {
  id: string;
  type: 'input' | 'loading' | 'completed';
  userMessage: string;
  assistantResponse: string;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Edge Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
```typescript
interface Edge {
  id: string;
  sourceNodeId: string;
  targetNodeId: string;
  type: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Component Specifications
**GraphCanvas Component** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- Location: `src/components/graph/GraphCanvas.tsx`
- Props: `conversation: Conversation`, `onNodeClick?: (nodeId: string) => void`, `onEdgeClick?: (edgeId: string) => void`
- Uses React Flow Provider for context
- Implements zoom, pan, and node interaction functionality

**React Flow Configuration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- React Flow version 11+ required
- ConnectionMode.Loose for flexible connections
- BackgroundVariant.Dots for visual grid
- Controls component for zoom/pan controls

### File Locations
**Component Files** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Main component: `src/components/graph/GraphCanvas.tsx`
- Types: `src/types/index.ts` (shared types)
- Tests: `tests/components/graph/GraphCanvas.test.tsx`

**Styling** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive design with utility classes
- Background color: `bg-gray-50` for canvas

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Test file: `tests/components/graph/GraphCanvas.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Test patterns: Component rendering, user interactions, responsive behavior

**Test Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-component-test]
- Use `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent` from React Testing Library
- Mock conversation data for testing
- Test user interactions (click, zoom, pan)
- Verify responsive behavior

### Technical Constraints
**React Flow Version** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- React Flow 11+ required
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- Next.js 15+ for React 19 compatibility

**Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- Implement proper state management patterns
- Optimize re-renders with useCallback

**Responsive Design** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Tailwind CSS for responsive utilities
- Mobile-first design approach
- Test on different screen sizes

### Testing
**Test File Location**: `tests/components/graph/GraphCanvas.test.tsx`

**Test Standards**: 
- Use Jest + React Testing Library
- Test component rendering with mock data
- Test user interactions (zoom, pan, node clicks)
- Test responsive behavior
- Mock React Flow components for unit testing

**Testing Frameworks**: Jest, React Testing Library, @testing-library/jest-dom

**Specific Testing Requirements for this Story**:
- Test React Flow integration and configuration
- Test zoom and pan functionality
- Test responsive canvas behavior
- Test node positioning and layout
- Test TypeScript type safety
