# Story 4.3: Edge Customization and Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to customize and manage edges between nodes,
**so that** I can create complex conversation structures.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Split button system provides "+" for auto-connect and separate button for manual edges
2. Manual edge creation allows connecting to any node's input area
3. Edge customization includes visual styling and connection types
4. Edge management allows deletion and modification of connections
5. Edge system maintains graph integrity and prevents invalid connections
6. Edge customization is intuitive and user-friendly
7. Edge changes are properly synchronized with backend

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement split button system (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Update BranchButton component to support split functionality
  - [ ] Add "+" button for auto-connect behavior

  - [ ] Implement edge creation UI with node selection
  - [ ] Add connection validation to prevent invalid edges
  - [ ] Create edge creation workflow in GraphCanvas
  - [ ] Add visual feedback during edge creation process

- [ ] Task 3: Implement edge customization features (AC: 3)

  - [ ] Add edge labeling and metadata display

- [ ] Task 4: Add edge management capabilities (AC: 4, 7)
  - [ ] Implement edge deletion functionality
  - [ ] Add edge modification/editing capabilities
  - [ ] Create edge management UI components
  - [ ] Integrate with backend synchronization

- [ ] Task 5: Update data models and API integration (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Extend Edge model for customization metadata
  - [ ] Update conversation service for edge management
  - [ ] Add API endpoints for edge CRUD operations
  - [ ] Implement backend validation for edge operations

- [ ] Task 6: Testing and validation (AC: 1-7)
  - [ ] Write unit tests for edge management components
  - [ ] Add integration tests for edge creation flow
  - [ ] Create E2E tests for edge customization
  - [ ] Test edge validation and error handling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Stories 4.1 and 4.2 establish markdown anchor system and context preprocessing
- Edge model already supports different types (auto, manual, markdown)
- Edge metadata structure is available for customization information

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#edge]
- Edge model includes `type` field with 'auto', 'manual', 'markdown' values
- Edge metadata can store customization information
- Edge model supports source and target node connections
- Edge creation timestamp and conversation ID tracking

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Need API endpoints for edge CRUD operations
- Edge creation should validate source/target node relationships
- Edge updates should maintain graph integrity
- Edge deletion should handle cascading effects

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- BranchButton component needs updates for split functionality
- New EdgeManager component for edge customization
- GraphCanvas component needs edge management integration
- Components should follow established TypeScript interface patterns

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Update existing: `src/components/graph/BranchButton.tsx`
- New component: `src/components/graph/EdgeManager.tsx`
- Update existing: `src/components/graph/GraphCanvas.tsx`
- Update types: `src/types/edge.ts` (if needed)
- Update service: `src/services/conversationService.ts`
- API route: `src/app/api/conversations/[id]/edges/route.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Unit tests: `tests/components/graph/EdgeManager.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `tests/components/graph/GraphCanvas.test.tsx`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/edge-management.spec.ts`
- Test file location follows `tests/components/` structure
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Playwright for E2E tests

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All API calls must go through service layer
- State updates must use proper state management patterns through GraphContext
- Graph operations must go through GraphContext
- Error handling through standard error handler
- Type sharing through `src/types/` directory

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: `tests/components/graph/` for component tests, `tests/e2e/` for E2E tests
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Test patterns**: Follow established component test patterns with proper mocking
- **E2E requirements**: Test complete edge management flow from creation to deletion
- **Coverage requirements**: All edge management functionality must be covered by tests
