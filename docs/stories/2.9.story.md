# Story 2.9: Contextual Menu with Create New Node

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to right-click on the canvas to open a contextual menu with options to create new nodes,
**so that** I can quickly add new conversation nodes at specific positions on the graph.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Right-clicking on empty canvas space opens a contextual menu
2. Contextual menu appears at the cursor position
3. Menu contains "Create new node" option as the first item
4. Clicking "Create new node" creates a new input node at the cursor position
5. New node is properly positioned and becomes active
6. Contextual menu closes after selecting an option or clicking elsewhere
7. Menu has proper styling and visual hierarchy
8. Right-clicking on existing nodes does not show the contextual menu
9. Menu is accessible and works with keyboard navigation
10. New node creation integrates with existing conversation state management

  - [x] Add createNodeAtPosition function
  - [x] Handle position-based node creation
  - [x] Ensure proper state updates and backend synchronization
  - [x] Maintain conversation integrity and edge management

- [x] Task 6: Create Unit Tests (AC: 1-10)
  - [x] Test contextual menu appearance and positioning

  - [x] Test node creation at cursor position
  - [x] Test keyboard navigation and accessibility
  - [x] Test integration with existing conversation state
  - [x] Test edge cases and error handling

## Dev Notes

### Accessibility
**Contextual Menu** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Proper ARIA labels and roles for menu components
- Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, enter, escape)
- Focus management and screen reader compatibility
- Proper semantic markup for interactive elements
- High contrast and visibility for menu items

**Node Creation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Clear visual feedback for new node creation
- Proper focus management after node creation
- Screen reader announcements for new nodes
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Consistent interaction patterns with existing features

### Technical Considerations
- Use React Flow's coordinate conversion utilities for accurate positioning
- Ensure contextual menu doesn't interfere with existing node interactions
- Implement proper event handling to prevent conflicts
- Consider mobile/touch device compatibility for future iterations
- Maintain performance with proper event delegation
