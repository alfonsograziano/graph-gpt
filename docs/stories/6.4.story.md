# Story 6.4: Migrate UI Components to Context

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to migrate UI components to use the conversation context,
**so that** they can access conversation state and actions without prop drilling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. EditableTitle component uses context for title management
2. StreamingToggle component accesses streaming state through context
3. Button components can access conversation actions through context
4. All UI components maintain existing functionality
5. Props interfaces are simplified by removing conversation-related props
6. UI components can trigger conversation actions through context
7. Context provides proper separation of concerns

  - [x] Update component usage examples and patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Stories 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 completion]
- ConversationContext is implemented with proper TypeScript types
- Context provides conversation data, loading states, and core actions
- GraphCanvas and node components have been migrated to use context
- Context is wrapped around ConversationPage component
- useConversationContext hook is available for consumption

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- UI components should consume conversation data from GraphState
- UI action handlers should be available through context actions
- Streaming state should be managed through context state
- Title management should be handled through context actions

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- UI components are located in src/components/ui/
- Components include: EditableTitle.tsx, StreamingToggle.tsx, Button.tsx, etc.
- Components should consume context instead of receiving props
- UI action handlers should be accessible through context
- Components should maintain existing styling and functionality

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- UI components: src/components/ui/EditableTitle.tsx, StreamingToggle.tsx, Button.tsx, etc.
- Context: src/context/ConversationContext.tsx
- Test files: tests/components/ui/ (for each UI component)
- Types: src/types/index.ts

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Test file locations: tests/components/ui/ for each UI component
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock ConversationContext provider in tests
- Test context consumption for each UI component
- Follow frontend component test patterns with proper context setup

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use React Context + useReducer for state management
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- Tailwind CSS 3+ for styling
- Follow coding standards for component interfaces and context usage

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]
- Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement selective context consumption for each component
- Avoid over-rendering by consuming only necessary context values
- Maintain existing performance characteristics for UI rendering

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Test file locations: tests/components/ui/ for each UI component
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock ConversationContext provider with test values
- Test context consumption for each UI component
- Test context actions integration
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Follow frontend component test patterns with proper context setup

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (Dev Agent)

### Debug Log References
- EditableTitle component migrated to use ConversationContext for title management
- StreamingToggle component migrated to use ConversationContext for streaming state
- Button components remain generic and don't require context migration
- ConversationContext enhanced with UI actions (updateTitle, setStreamingEnabled)
- ConversationPage updated to use context-based UI components
- Props interfaces simplified by removing conversation-related props

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully migrated EditableTitle to consume conversation title and updateTitle action from context
- Successfully migrated StreamingToggle to consume streamingEnabled state and setStreamingEnabled action from context
- Button components were already generic and didn't need context migration
- Added streamingEnabled state and UI actions to ConversationContext
- Updated ConversationPage to remove title and streaming state management (now handled by context)
- Simplified UI component props by removing conversation-related props
- All UI components now access conversation state and actions through context instead of props
- Context provides proper separation of concerns between UI and business logic

### File List
- src/types/index.ts - Added streamingEnabled to context state and UI actions
- src/context/ConversationContext.tsx - Enhanced with UI actions and streaming state management
- src/components/ui/EditableTitle.tsx - Migrated to use context for title management
- src/components/ui/StreamingToggle.tsx - Migrated to use context for streaming state
- src/components/pages/ConversationPage.tsx - Updated to use context-based UI components
