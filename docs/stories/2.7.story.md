# Story 2.7: Node Deletion with Hover Delete Button

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to delete nodes by clicking a delete button that appears when I hover over a node,
**so that** I can remove unwanted conversation branches and clean up my graph.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Delete button appears in the top-right corner of each node when hovered
2. Delete button is visually distinct and clearly indicates deletion action
3. Clicking the delete button immediately deletes the node without confirmation
4. All edges connected to the deleted node are also removed
5. Node deletion updates the conversation state and syncs with backend
6. Deleted nodes are completely removed from the graph visualization
7. Node deletion works for all node types (input, loading, completed)
8. Graph layout adjusts properly after node deletion
9. No orphaned edges remain after node deletion
10. Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
