# Graph GPT

A graph-based interface for LLM interactions that mirrors human thinking patterns. Instead of linear chat conversations, Graph GPT allows you to explore multiple conversation paths simultaneously, creating a visual knowledge graph of your AI interactions.

## üåü Key Features

- **Non-linear Conversations**: Create multiple conversation branches from any point in your interaction
- **Visual Graph Interface**: Intuitive node-based conversation management using React Flow
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live markdown rendering as the AI responds
- **Contextual Branching**: Create new nodes from specific parts of AI responses
- **Conversation Persistence**: Save and manage multiple conversation graphs
- **Interactive Node Management**: Click to activate conversation paths, drag to reposition nodes
- **Smart Context**: Automatically includes relevant conversation history when branching

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+
- MongoDB (local with Docker, or cloud instance)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-gpt.git
   cd graph-gpt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Add your configuration:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/graph-gpt
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB** (if running locally with Docker)
   ```bash
   npm run start:mongodb
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üéØ How It Works

### Traditional Chat vs Graph GPT

**Traditional Chat**: Linear conversation flow
```
User ‚Üí AI ‚Üí User ‚Üí AI ‚Üí User ‚Üí AI
```

**Graph GPT**: Non-linear, explorative flow
```
User ‚Üí AI ‚Üí [Branch A: User ‚Üí AI] ‚Üí [Branch B: User ‚Üí AI]
         ‚Üò [Branch C: User ‚Üí AI] 
```

### Core Concepts

1. **Nodes**: Each conversation point becomes a visual node
2. **Branches**: Create new conversation paths from any node
3. **Context**: Active conversation path provides context to the AI
4. **Visualization**: See your entire conversation as an interactive graph
